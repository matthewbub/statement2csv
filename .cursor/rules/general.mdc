# GENERAL RULES

- Always use the most minimal approach possible to solve a task.
- Use Object Oriented Design Patterns in your approaches whenever it makes sense too.
- Use JSDoc Style Code Comments to add context to functions.
- In-flight server events should use Server Actions.
- Use the `supabaseFaceade.getOrMakeUser` method in [server-utils.ts](mdc:src/lib/server-utils.ts) as the sole way to obtain the userId.
- The `TableNames` object is the only way we're allowed to reference the DB.

## ERROR HANDLING

Use Sentry

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```
